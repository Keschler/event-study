Regression: return impact vs. tweet sentiment
----------------------------------------------
Model: ret_post_minus_pre = alpha + beta * sentiment_compound + error
alpha: 2.587346e-03
beta:  -1.994309e-03  (≈ -0.199431% per 1.0 sentiment unit)
p-value(beta): 0.1484
R²: 0.0263

Interpretation of regression coefficient:
- The estimated beta is -1.994309e-03, which is not statistically significant (p ≥ 0.10).
- On average, more positive tweet sentiment is associated with lower post-minus-pre returns.
- A full change of sentiment from -1.0 to +1.0 would correspond to about -0.398862% change
  in the post-minus-pre log return, if the linear model is taken literally.

Note:
- R² indicates how much of the variation in return impact is explained by sentiment alone.
- Even a statistically significant beta with low R² means sentiment moves the index a bit,
  but most of the movement is still driven by other factors (news, macro data, noise, etc.).
Bottom line:
- The average impact is large enough to be economically meaningful.
- The statistical evidence that sentiment matters is weak in this sample.
